## About the Project

Ayanfe’s work focuses on the Yoruba pantheon of deities, or _Orishas_, and their relevance to modern identity. Her art tells stories of gods like Ọbatala, the gender-fluid sculptor of mankind, and Sango, whose flawed relationships reveal timeless truths about human nature. By retelling these myths, she aims to preserve Yoruba history and inspire a deeper understanding of ourselves.

### Key Themes:

- **Cultural Preservation**: Reviving Yoruba folklore and heritage through art.
- **Identity and Gender**: Exploring themes of gender fluidity and self-discovery.
- **Human Imperfection**: Celebrating flaws and imperfections as part of the human experience.
